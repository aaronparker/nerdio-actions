# Azure Virtual Desktop images

## Install scripts

Image scripts for customising Windows 10/11 Enterprise and Enterprise multi-session images for use with Azure Virtual Desktop via Nerdio Manager scripted actions. These scripts can be used to update an existing gold image or session host - where possible, application update features are disabled.

Scripts use [Evergreen](https://stealthpuppy.com/evergreen/) to determine the latest version of an application. Running each script will install the latest version on a clean image or update an existing application install on a gold image or existing session hosts.

Where supported, application installers will save install logs to `$Env:SystemRoot\Logs\ImageBuild`.
